==== HFP using pulseaudio/ofono/bluez

== Prepare software
It is not necessary to build everything from scratch. It is possible to use
any versions available in the distribution in use. However brief build
instructions are provided here for specific versions of the software in use.
Specified versions have been tested, others were not. So there are might be some
incompatibilities between pulseaudio/ofono/bluez when their version don't
match: e.g. incorrect dbus method signatures and so on. In this case careful
debug log inspection may help to detect the problem.

Prerequisite: alsa libs and utils, libasound2, libsndfile, speex and some other deps

    host# cd pulseaudio
    host# ./autogen.sh
    host# make && make install


==== Setup software

Note that location of config files may differ from one system to another. For
instance, it can be /etc or /usr/local/etc. E.g., latter is the case in some
distributions for manually built software.

* bluez

audio configuration: /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf

Make sure that the following settings are available in bluez4 audio
configuration:

[General]
Master=true
Enable=Gateway,Socket,Source,Sink,Media,Control,Headset
AutoConnect=true

[Headset]
HFP=true
MaxConnected=1

[A2DP]
SBCSources=1
MPEG12Sources=0

* pulseaudio

system config: /etc/pulse/system.pa or /usr/local/etc/pulse/system.pa

Make sure that the following settings are available in pulseaudio system
configuration:

### Automatically suspend sinks/sources that become idle for too long
load-module module-suspend-on-idle timeout=60

### Bluetooth modules
load-module module-bluetooth-discover

# !!!! only for pulseaudio-v4.0
load-module module-bluetooth-policy hfgw=1


==== Start software

To run demo we need several test scripts from bluez4 and ofono source trees:

* from ofono (<ofono>/test/)
  answer-calls
  dial-numbe
  hangup-active
  list-modem
  enable-modem
  disable-modem

* from bluez4 (<bluez4>/test/)
  simple-agent

Open four consoles on the system and run all involved pieces of software in
foreground mode in order to monitor debug output:

    host-1# blutoothd -d -n

    host-2# ofono -d -n

    host-3# pulseaudio -vvv


==== HFP demo with pulseaudio-4.0

Scan bluetooth devices and found your phone:
    host-4# hcitool scan
    Scanning ...
        34:7E:39:33:AC:6D   5800

Pair with your phone:
    host-4# ./simple-agent hci0 34:7E:39:33:AC:6D
    RequestPinCode (/org/bluez/31485/hci0/dev_34_7E_39_33_AC_6D)
    Enter PIN Code: 0000
    Release
    New device (/org/bluez/31485/hci0/dev_34_7E_39_33_AC_6D)


List modems:
    host-4# ./list-modems
    [ /hfp/001583C707B3_347E3933AC6D ]
        Features =
        Emergency = 0
        Powered = 0
        Lockdown = 0
        Interfaces =
        Online = 0
        Type = hfp
        Name = 5800

Enable your phone as modem:
    host-4# ./enable-modem
    Connecting modem /hfp/001583C707B3_347E3933AC6D...

Make/accept calls:

* Make call:
    host-4# ./dial-number XXXXX

* Hangup active call:
    host-4# ./hangup-active

* Accept incoming calls:
    host-4# ./answer-calls

Disable modem:
    host-4# ./disable-modem


==== HFP demo with pulseaudio-2.1
In earlier versions of pulseaudio there is no bluetooth-policy module which
automatically connects bluetooth audio sink/source with default audio
source/sink using loopback. In this case that connection should be done
manually. That is why all the steps are the same as in the previous case, but
there is a couple of additional commands to pulseaudio.

Normal workflow:
    host-4# ./simple-agent hci0 34:7E:39:33:AC:6D
    host-4# ./enable-modem
    host-4# ./dial-number XXXXX

And now manual connection of pulseaudio sources/sinks:

    host-4# pactl load-module module-loopback sink=alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00-Headset.analog-stereo source=bluez_source.34_7E_39_33_AC_6D source_dont_move=true sink_dont_move=true latency_msec=1
    host-4# pactl load-module module-loopback source=alsa_input.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00-Headset.analog-mono sink=bluez_sink.34_7E_39_33_AC_6D source_dont_move=true sink_dont_move=true latency_msec=1

Here Logitech is a default audio card in this example setup.

Then again normal workflow:
    host-4# ./hangup-active


==== HFP demo: troubleshooting

* check unix permissions carefully
Make sure that all daemons in use have access to required facilities, e.g.:
  - pulseaudio needs access to /dev/snd => pulse should be in audio group
  - test user needs access to pulseaudio (using pactl) => this user should be in pulse-access group
  - and so on: check logs !!!

* check dbus permissions
Make sure that pulseaudio has access to bluez4 over dbus. Otherwise some
strange crashes may occur. Fortunately pulseaudio loudly complains (in red
color) when something is wrong. In that case you may need to explicitely punch
some holes in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/bluetooth.conf, e.g.:

    <policy group="pulse">
        <allow send_destination="org.bluez"/>
    </policy>

* pulseaudio crash on resampling
Once or twice I observed pulseaudio crash during resampling adjustment. That
crash can be eliminated using '--resample-method=trivial' pulseaudio command
line switch.

* dbus interface incompatibility
It is possible to stumble upon dbus interface incompatibility problem: e.g.
bluez4 provides interface which differs from what pulseaudio or ofono expect.
Usually this means that one of those components should be updated.

* logs !!! logs !!! logs !!!
Start all three daemons in foreground mode with verbose debug and carefully
check what they complain about.
