==== HOWTO for iMX53 Quick Start Board

* HOW-TO prepare u-boot

NB: there is a good and detailed explanation available: see doc/README.imximage in u-boot source tree.

1. Configure and build U-Boot

    host# make LANG=C CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/toolchain mx53loco_config
    host# make LANG=C CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/toolchain u-boot.imx

    The result is u-boot image specific for imx: u-boot.imx

2. Write u-boot to mmc card
    Prepare mmc card in a usual way, but start the first partition not from
    the first cylinder: keep some space in the beginning of mmc card for
    u-boot.imx image. The actual start cylinder depends on card geometry
    (cylinder size) and u-boot.imx image size.

    After mmc and its partition are ready, then write u-boot.imx image:

    host# sudo dd if=./u-boot.imx of=/dev/sdX bs=512 seek=2

    This command copies the u-boot image at the address 0x400, as required
    by the processor.
