==== How to create jffs2 image from directory structure.

Here we provide guidelines which are suitable for beagleboard (endianness,
block size and other settings), but it can be easily tweaked for any other
system.

* Suppose that we have prepared rootfs directory structure located in rootfs directory.

* If you use debian you will need the following packages:

	host# sudo aptitude install mtd-tools mtd-utils

* Use mkfs.jffs2 to create jffs2 image

	host# mkfs.jffs2 -lnp -e 0x20000 -s 2048 -d ./rootfs -o image.jffs2

options stand for:
  -r, -d, --root=DIR
	Build file system from directory DIR.  The default is the current
	directory.

  -o, --output=FILE
	Write JFFS2 image to file FILE.  Default is the standard output.

  -l, --little-endian
  	create little-endian jffs2 image

  -n, --no-cleanmarkers
	Do not write ´CLEANMARKER´ nodes to the beginning of each erase block.
	This option  can  be  useful  for  creating JFFS2 images for use on
	NAND flash, and for creating images which are to be used on a variety
	of hardware with differing erase‐block sizes

  -p, --pad[=SIZE]
	Pad output to SIZE bytes with 0xFF.  If SIZE is not specified, the
	output is padded to the end of the final erase block.

  -e, --eraseblock=SIZE
	Use  erase block size SIZE.  The default is 64 KiB.  If you use a
	erase block size different than the erase block size of the target MTD
	device, JFFS2 may not perform optimally. If the SIZE specified is
	below 4096, the units are assumed to be KiB.

  -s, --pagesize=SIZE
	Use page size SIZE.  The default is 4 KiB.  This size is the maximum
	size of a data node.

==== How to burn jffs2 image to nand flash

* Figure out amount of eraseblocks:

	dev# mtdinfo /dev/mtd2
		mtd2
		Name:                           rootfs
		Type:                           nand
		Eraseblock size:                131072 bytes, 128.0 KiB
		Amount of eraseblocks:          4075 (534118400 bytes, 509.4 MiB)
		Minimum input/output unit size: 2048 bytes
		Sub-page size:                  512 bytes
		OOB size:                       64 bytes
		Character device major/minor:   90:4
		Bad blocks are allowed:         true
		Device is writable:             true

* Cleanup nand partition

	dev# flash_erase /dev/mtd2 0 4075

* Write new jffs2 image

	dev# nandwrite -p -m  /dev/mtd2 /path/to/image.jffs2
